That's right, even though the cups are thoroughly washed after every use, they will still use 76% less water over their lifecycle when compared to a single-use plastic-lined paper coffee cup! \r\n\r\nWhy's that you might ask? With modern dishwashers, cleaning Bean Drop cups uses very little water, whilst a single-use takeaway cup uses vast amounts of water in its original manufacturing process! So whilst Bean Drop cups use water after each use for cleaning, you can be confident they use far less water than a normal single-use coffee cup, and at the same time, the Bean Drop cups are reducing carbon emissions.",

Customers receive their coffee* in reusable cups instead of the single-use plastic-lined takeaway cups that most cafes currently offer. By using reusable cups, customers can return their cups once they are finished, reducing landfill waste, C02 emissions, and water waste compared to a single-use coffee cup.\r\n\r\nBean Drop will wash the cups so customers don't have to; combining the convenience of single-use coffee cups with the environmentally friendly nature of a reusable cup.\r\n\r\nIt won't cost you a penny more and you'll be saving the environment!\r\n\r\nBean Drop can collect, clean, and distribute coffee cups for the exact same price as single-use coffee cups! As a customer, you won't pay a penny extra for your cup of coffee! And whilst you enjoy your favourite coffee in our uniquely identifiable reusable cups, you can be happy in the knowledge you've helped reduce CO2 emissions by 96%! In fact even though we will wash the cups after every use, you will still reduce the total water usage of cups by 76% when using a Bean Drop cup compared with a normal single-use cup.",
